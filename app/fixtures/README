to dump the database use the command (make sure that the database is migrated to
the current version of the model first by running `python manage.py
showmigrations` first and reading up on django migrations if there are some
boxes without checkmarks)

```
python manage.py dumpdata --format=json app auth sessions > app/fixtures/initial_data.json
```

sessions is currently included because some part of the model (sessiontags I
think) refers to it. If we remove sessiontags, we don't need to dump the
sessions. This is desirable because the session data changes very very
frequently.

to verify that the data was dumped correctl switch the database in
advisor/settings.py over to sqlite3 and run

```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata initial_data
```

The two commands should run without errors. IF THEY PRODUCE ERRORS, SOMETHING IS
VERY WRONG AND SHOULD PROBABLY BE FIXED.

To restore the database from scratch, the easiest way would be to DROP the
database with psql (@m.chlepakov how do you do that), recreate it (also with
psql) and run

```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py loaddata initial_data
```

again.
